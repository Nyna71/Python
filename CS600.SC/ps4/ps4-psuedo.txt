Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:
find_best_shift

start with shift n = 1

repeat
   try decode with shift n
   count number of valid words with shift n
   if all decoded words are valid words, n is best shift
   increase n by 1, until n reaches 27
